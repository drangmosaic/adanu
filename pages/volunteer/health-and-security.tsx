                                <em>Ebola</em> &#8211; Ghana is located in West Africa, which has been
                                the geographic region for deadly outbreaks of Ebola. However, only 3 of
                                West Africa’s 18 countries were adversely affected by Ebola, and there
                                were no outbreaks ever reported in Ghana. That said, it is important to
                                understand the Ebola outbreak, and the role that Ghana played to lend help
                                and support to its affected neighbors.

                                Ebola reached epidemic proportions in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone in
                                2014 and early 2015. Approximately 11,000 people died due to a lack of
                                1)appropriate health care, 2)understanding how the disease spread, and
                                3)ability to effectively communicate with citizens. As you can see by

                                map of West Africa</a>, Ghana has no borders with any of the affected countries.
                                In fact, the Ghana government offered and was chosen by the United Nations to host
                                UNMEER (United Nations Emergency Ebola Response) due to Ghana’s distance from
                                infected countries and its relative health and security. UNMEER was closed
                                down in Ghana June 2015 as the outbreak has faded.

                                <em>Other Health Issues</em> &#8211; It is always wise to take precautions
                                to prevent contracting diseases. Ebola and many other diseases
                                (Hepatitis A and B, typhoid, cholera, HIV/AIDS, etc) can be spread through
                                shared bodily fluids,  unclean food and unclean water. Adanu has an outstanding
                                record of “healthy immersion”, offering bottled water and specially prepared meals.
                                Any eating establishments we visit are trusted to serve appropriately prepared food.

                                Yellow Fever is the only vaccination required by Ghana law. Additionally, Ghana is
                                a known malarial country, and it is necessary to take anti-malaria medication
                                throughout the trip. For other vaccinations and medications to consider,
                                please visit

                                Ghana regained its independence in 1957, and since 1992 it has established itself
                                as a stable democracy due to its ability to consistently transition from one
                                legitimately elected ruler to the next. Ghana is currently a very safe country
                                with relatively low crime levels compared to other West African countries.
                                As with any country or city worldwide, you should be aware of your surroundings
                                and use caution when you are in unfamiliar surroundings. Take sensible precautions
                                but be assured it is quite safe.
                            </p>

                                With the increase in global religious conflict, it is good to note that
                                Ghana has an excellent history of religious tolerance and inclusion.
                                The country is approximately 70% Christian, followed by Muslim and Traditionalist
                                religions. It is likely that when you go to villages you will see Christians,
                                Traditionalists and Muslims living and working side-by-side.
